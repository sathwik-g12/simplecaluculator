# simplecaluculator

This code implements a simple calculator using JavaScript, designed to run within a web browser. The main functionality includes basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus), handling decimal numbers, and providing utility functions like reset and backspace. It uses an object-oriented approach, encapsulating the calculator's state and behavior within a single object.

The `calculator` object maintains the state of the calculator, including the current value displayed (`displayValue`), the first operand for calculations (`firstOperand`), a flag indicating whether the calculator is waiting for the second operand (`waitingForSecondOperand`), and the operator for the current operation (`operator`). This structure allows the calculator to manage its state effectively and perform operations based on user input.

The `inputDigit` function handles digit inputs. It updates the `displayValue` based on whether the calculator is waiting for the second operand. If it is, the new digit replaces the current display value; otherwise, the digit is appended to the existing display value. This function ensures that multiple digit inputs are correctly concatenated to form multi-digit numbers.

The `inputDecimal` function manages the input of decimal points. It prevents adding multiple decimal points to the display value and ensures that the decimal point is only added when the calculator is not waiting for the second operand. This function helps maintain the integrity of decimal numbers entered by the user.

The `handleOperator` function processes operator inputs. It performs the necessary calculations if an operator is already present and updates the `firstOperand` and `displayValue` accordingly. It also sets the `waitingForSecondOperand` flag to true, indicating that the next input should be the second operand for the operation. This function allows the calculator to chain operations together by continually updating the result.

The `calculate` function performs the actual arithmetic operations. It takes two operands and an operator as arguments and returns the result of the operation. This function handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations, providing the core computational functionality of the calculator.

The `resetCalculator` function resets the calculator's state to its default values. It sets the `displayValue` to '0', clears the `firstOperand`, resets the `waitingForSecondOperand` flag, and clears the `operator`. This function provides a way to clear the calculator and start a new calculation.

The `backspace` function allows the user to remove the last digit or character from the display value. It slices the `displayValue` string from the beginning to the second-to-last character, or resets it to '0' if the display value becomes empty. This function provides a way to correct input errors without resetting the entire calculation.

The `updateDisplay` function updates the calculator's display to reflect the current `displayValue`. It selects the display element and sets its value to the `displayValue`. This function ensures that the user interface accurately reflects the calculator's state.

The code sets up event listeners to handle user interactions. The `DOMContentLoaded` event listener ensures that the calculator initialization and event binding occur after the DOM is fully loaded. The `keys` element, representing the calculator's buttons, listens for click events and calls the appropriate function based on the button's value. The switch statement within the event listener determines the type of input (digit, operator, decimal, etc.) and calls the corresponding function to update the calculator's state.

Overall, this code provides a functional and interactive calculator with a clean and modular structure, making it easy to understand, maintain, and extend with additional features if needed.
